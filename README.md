It covers everything from basics to advanced use cases like validating LLM responses and using Pydantic in tool calling.

## 📘 What’s Inside
- Pydantic basics and data validation
- Validating LLM responses with Pydantic
- Using Pydantic for tool calling
- Practical, hands-on Python notebooks

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pydantic-llms.git
cd pydantic_for_llms
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage
Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore:
>>> jupyter notebook

📜 License
Would you like me to also **create a sample `requirements.txt`** with the most common dependencies (like `pydantic`, `jupyter`, `openai`/`litellm`) to go along with this?

🙏 Courtesy

Some of the ideas and inspiration for these notebooks come from the excellent courses and materials by DeepLearning.AI.
Huge thanks to their team for making AI education accessible!
